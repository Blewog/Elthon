## write function
### write.console()
write.console() is essentially just print. example: write.console("Hello World", "return") which would print "Hello World". Heres a breakdown of the function: the first thing in quotations is the message to be printed, and the second thing in quotations is what the end will be, if its "return" then it will return on a new line just like normal print, if it was ". " then it would print "Hello World. " and not be on a new line.

### write.undrline()
write.undrline() is near the same as write.console(), ill show you an example: write.undrline("Hello World", "return") which would print "<ins>Hello World</ins>" thats all you need to know since its near the same as write.console() but it underlines.

### write.bold()
write.bold() is also near the same as write.console(), heres an example: write.bold("Hello World", "return") which would print "__Hello World__" just the same as the others but it bolds.
