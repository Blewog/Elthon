## write function
### write.console()
write.console() is essentially just print, an example is: write.console("Hello World", "return") which would print "Hello World". Heres a breakdown: the first thing in quotations is the message to be printed, and the second thing in quotations is what the end will be, if its "return" then it will return on a new line just like normal print, if it was lets say ". " then it would print "Hello World. " and not be on a new line.
