## The write function
### write.console()
write.console() is essentially just print. example: write.console("Hello World") which would print "Hello World". Heres a breakdown of the function: its just print so the thing in quotations is what will be printed.

### write.undrline()
write.undrline() is near the same as write.console(), ill show you an example: write.undrline("Hello World") which would print "<ins>Hello World</ins>" thats all you need to know since its near the same as write.console() but it underlines.

### write.bold()
write.bold() is also near the same as write.console(), heres an example: write.bold("Hello World") which would print "__Hello World__" just the same as the others but it bolds.

### extras
This explanation wont be too long. there are currently two things you can change which are color and the end, the available colors are purple, cyan, darkcyan, blue, green, yellow, and red. And the end one is just end on print.
